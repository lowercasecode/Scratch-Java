# Scratch-Java
Hello.
Um.. first time making a reperiatory heh...
So.. if you're viewing this, I'm sure you are familiar with or have heard of the coding platform Scratch (scratch.mit.edu).
But. Scratch may be easy to learn.. but it has its limits.
So this is some popular Scratch projects that you can expand on in JavaScript.

What literally fueled this thing was Leopard (https://leopardjs.com/). Its Github is linked in the footer.
