# Scratch-Java
Hello.
Um.. first time making a reperiatory heh...
So.. if you're viewing this, I'm sure you are familiar with or have heard of the coding platform Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu).
But. Scratch may be easy to learn.. but it has its limits.
So I am going to put every featured project (starting 3/4/24) into JavaScript.

Once this gets old enough, feel free to use this as an unblocked wayback machine.

What literally fueled this thing was Leopard (https://leopardjs.com/). Its Github is linked in the footer.
